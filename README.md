# README

Hello, everyone! This is GitHub. I suggest you find out how to use this site because we will be using it to share our code. Check out some of the guides they provide for this website here: https://guides.github.com/. The "Hello World" guide is probably the most useful. 

This is the repository for the swivel drive. Our files for the swivel drive will go here. Branches, commits, and pull requests are all core parts of GitHub, and you can read about them in the "Hello World" guide. "Understanding the GitHub Flow" also has some good clarifying information.
